              Ted Rust's Biography
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              On Christmas Eve in 1975, I was called by God through my father's
              sermon into parish ministry. After completing a degree from
              Capital University in Columbus, Ohio, I graduated from Trinity
              Seminary and later earned a Doctorate in Ministry from Pittsburgh
              Theological Seminary. My dissertation focus, â€œThe harvest is
              plentiful, but the laborers are few. Therefore pray earnestly to
              the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."
              Luke 10:2.
            </p>
            <p>
              This verse still inspires me to bring people to know, love, trust
              and serve Jesus, the Risen Christ. I have served growing
              congregations in Ohio and North Carolina and served as a mission
              developer in Lexington, Kentucky. My ministry includes music; I
              sing, play the keyboard and guitar, and do a little bit of
              songwriting too. In my free time I like to run, do yard work and
              play golf. I look forward to meeting you online or in person and
              to share with you the Good News of God's love and his promises
